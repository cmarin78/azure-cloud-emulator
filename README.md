# Azure Emulator

A local Microsoft Azure emulator written in Go. The goal is to expose REST
APIs compatible with Azure's management and data-plane endpoints (Storage,
Key Vault, Compute, and others), persist everything in a single embedded
file (BoltDB), and ship with a lightweight web console for inspecting
resources — no real Azure subscription, nothing external required.

Same idea as [gcp-emulator](../gcp-emulator), aimed at Azure instead of
GCP: a portable binary (or container) that runs the same way on Windows,
Linux, or macOS, against which you can point the real `az` CLI, the Azure
Terraform provider (`azurerm`), and the official Azure SDKs by overriding
their endpoints to `localhost`.

## Current status

All 15 core phases below are complete, plus Phase 20 (real Action Group
webhook delivery). See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned next
(the rest of the behavioral/real-delivery layer inspired by
gcp-emulator's own Phase 11).

| Phase | Area | What's implemented |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Core server | HTTP router (logging/recover/CORS middleware), ARM resource-ID parsing, `api-version` validation, async-operation (LRO) helper (`Azure-AsyncOperation`/`Location` polling), embedded BoltDB persistence, `/healthz` |
| 2 | Resource Manager | Fake subscriptions, resource group CRUD (create/update, get, list, async delete) |
| 3 | Storage | Storage account ARM CRUD, blob containers/blobs, queue storage, table storage (all data-plane) |
| 4 | Compute | Virtual networks/subnets, network interfaces, managed disks, static VM image catalog, virtual machines (create/get/delete, start/stop — all async) |
| 5 | Key Vault | Vault ARM CRUD, plus secrets/keys/certificates (data-plane, simulated cryptographic material) |
| 6 | Service Bus + Cosmos DB | Service Bus namespaces (async), queues/topics/subscriptions (sync) + send/peek-lock-receive/complete; Cosmos DB SQL API accounts (async), databases/containers (sync) + document CRUD |
| 7 | Web console | Minimal vanilla-JS console (`web/console`, no build step), served by the binary — resource groups, storage accounts, VMs, Key Vault vaults, Service Bus namespaces, Cosmos DB accounts |
| 8 | az/azurerm compatibility | Fake ARM metadata endpoint, fake Azure AD token issuer, Microsoft Graph stub, `providers` registration endpoint, optional self-signed HTTPS, ARM case-insensitive path matching |
| 9 | Test suite + CI | One `*_test.go` per service package, a `cmd/azure-emulator` registration test (catches route conflicts), GitHub Actions CI |
| 10 | Monitor + Log Analytics | Log Analytics workspaces (+ `sharedKeys`, + Query data-plane stub), action groups, metric alerts (all ARM CRUD, sync) |
| 11 | App Service | App Service Plans, Web Apps (+ start/stop/restart, `config/appsettings` sub-resource) |
| 12 | Networking | NSGs + security rules, Public IP addresses, Load Balancers, Route Tables + routes, Private DNS zones + record sets |
| 13 | AKS | Managed clusters + agent pools (async), `listClusterUserCredential`/`listClusterAdminCredential` — shape-compatible only, no real Kubernetes control plane |
| 14 | Functions | Function definitions, `syncfunctiontriggers`, `host/default/listkeys` — reuses Phase 11's App Service site, no new resource type needed |
| 15 | Entra ID & RBAC | App registrations, service principals, custom role definitions, role assignments (scope-isolated subscription/resource-group storage) — no real directory or authorization evaluation |
| 20 | Action Groups: real webhook delivery | `POST .../actionGroups/{name}/createNotifications` dispatches a real HTTP POST to each `webhookReceivers` entry; result recorded via `lastNotificationTime`/`lastNotificationStatus` (emulator-only fields) |

### Feature matrix (detail)

- **Storage**: ✅ storage accounts (ARM CRUD), ✅ blob containers/blobs
  (data-plane: create/list/get/delete containers, upload/download/list/
  delete blobs), ✅ queue storage (data-plane: create/list/get-metadata/
  delete queues, put/peek/get(dequeue)/delete messages, visibility
  timeout + pop receipts), ✅ table storage (data-plane: create/list/
  delete tables, insert/get/query/replace/merge/delete entities with a
  simplified `$filter` subset).
- **Key Vault**: ✅ vaults (ARM CRUD), ✅ secrets (data-plane CRUD), ✅ keys
  (data-plane CRUD, simulated JWK material), ✅ certificates (data-plane
  CRUD, simulated cert material — no real X.509/crypto operations).
- **Compute**: ✅ virtual networks/subnets, ✅ network interfaces, ✅ managed
  disks, ✅ static VM image catalog, ✅ virtual machines (create/get/
  delete, start/stop — all async, matching real Azure's LRO pattern).
- **Resource Manager**: ✅ resource groups, fake subscriptions, ARM-style
  long-running operations.
- **Service Bus**: ✅ namespaces (ARM CRUD, async), ✅ queues and topics/
  subscriptions (ARM CRUD, sync), ✅ message send/peek-lock-receive/
  complete (data-plane, with topic-to-subscriptions fan-out).
- **Cosmos DB**: ✅ SQL API accounts (ARM CRUD, async), ✅ databases and
  containers (ARM CRUD, sync, partition key required), ✅ document CRUD
  (data-plane: put/create/get/list/delete, simplified vs real Azure —
  plain JSON body instead of partition-key headers).
- ✅ Web console for browsing emulated resources (read/list plus create/
  delete for resource groups, storage accounts, vaults, Service Bus
  namespaces, Cosmos DB accounts; VMs are list/start/stop/delete only).
- ✅ Real `az`/`azurerm` compatibility: ARM metadata discovery, fake AAD
  token issuer, Microsoft Graph stub, `providers` registration, optional
  self-signed TLS, and case-insensitive ARM path matching.
- ✅ Automated test suite (one `*_test.go` per service package, plus a
  `cmd/azure-emulator` registration test) and GitHub Actions CI.
- **Monitor + Log Analytics**: ✅ Log Analytics workspaces (ARM CRUD,
  sync, plus a `sharedKeys` action), ✅ Log Analytics Query data-plane
  stub (always returns an empty result table), ✅ action groups (ARM
  CRUD, sync), ✅ metric alerts (ARM CRUD, sync, referencing an action
  group by id).
- **App Service**: ✅ App Service Plans (ARM CRUD, sync), ✅ Web Apps
  (ARM CRUD, sync; start/stop/restart actions; `config/appsettings`
  StringDictionary sub-resource with full-replace semantics).
- **Networking**: ✅ Network Security Groups + security rules (ARM CRUD,
  sync), ✅ Public IP addresses (ARM CRUD, sync, deterministic fake IP),
  ✅ Load Balancers (ARM CRUD, sync; inline frontend/backend/rule/probe
  collections), ✅ Route Tables + routes (ARM CRUD, sync), ✅ Private DNS
  zones + record sets (ARM CRUD, sync; A/CNAME).
- **AKS**: ✅ managed clusters (ARM CRUD, async; synthesized default
  agent pool, deterministic fake `fqdn`/identity), ✅ agent pools (ARM
  CRUD, async, independently routable sub-resource), ✅
  `listClusterUserCredential`/`listClusterAdminCredential` (sync, fake
  base64 kubeconfig) — shape-compatible only, no real Kubernetes
  control plane.
- **Functions**: ✅ function definitions (ARM CRUD, sync, sub-resource
  of an App Service site), ✅ `syncfunctiontriggers` (sync action, no
  body), ✅ `host/default/listkeys` (sync action, deterministic fake
  `masterKey`/`functionKeys`) — the Function App itself needs no new
  code, it's a `Microsoft.Web/sites` resource already supported by
  Phase 11's App Service implementation.
- **Entra ID & RBAC**: ✅ app registrations (`v1.0/applications`,
  extends the Phase 8 Microsoft Graph stub), ✅ service principals
  (explicit `POST` plus `$filter=appId eq '...'` auto-discovery), ✅
  custom role definitions (`Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions`,
  ARM CRUD, sync), ✅ role assignments
  (`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments`, ARM CRUD, sync,
  scope-isolated subscription/resource-group storage) — no real
  directory or authorization evaluation behind it.
- **Action Groups real webhook delivery (Phase 20)**: ✅
  `POST .../actionGroups/{name}/createNotifications` sends a real HTTP
  POST (Azure common-alert-schema-shaped JSON body) to every
  `webhookReceivers` entry on the action group, recording the outcome
  via emulator-only `lastNotificationTime`/`lastNotificationStatus`
  fields — no retry/dead-lettering, and email/SMS/Azure Function
  receivers remain shape-only with no real delivery.

```

## Requirements

- Go 1.22+ (only needed to build from source — see "Running with Docker"
  below if you'd rather not install it)
- Azure CLI / Terraform (optional, to exercise real commands against the
  emulator once it has endpoints implemented)

> Note: this repo does not bundle the Go toolchain. If you don't have it
> installed, get it from https://go.dev/dl/ (or `winget install GoLang.Go`
> on Windows, `brew install go` on macOS, `apt install golang-go` on
> Linux).

## Running

```bash
cd azure-emulator
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd/azure-emulator
```

By default it listens on `:10000` and persists to
`.azure-emulator-data/azure-emulator.db`. `GET /healthz` confirms the
process is up. Both can be overridden with `-addr`/`-db` flags or the
`AZURE_EMULATOR_ADDR`/`AZURE_EMULATOR_DB` environment variables (the
latter is what the Docker image uses).

## Web console

Once the emulator is running, visit `http://localhost:10000/` for a
minimal web console covering resource groups, storage accounts,
virtual machines, Key Vault vaults, Service Bus namespaces, and Cosmos
DB accounts (scoped to whatever's implemented so far). It's a plain
HTML/CSS/JS app with no build step, served by the binary itself and
talking to the emulator's own JSON REST API via `fetch`.

The console's static files live in `web/console` and are served from
the `-web` flag's directory (default `web/console`; override with
`AZURE_EMULATOR_WEB`). If that directory doesn't exist, the console is
silently disabled and only the REST API is served.

## Enabling HTTPS

Both az CLI and the `azurerm` Terraform provider refuse to treat a
custom cloud as valid over plain HTTP — pointing them at the emulator
for real authentication/ARM calls requires `-tls`:

```bash
go run ./cmd/azure-emulator -tls
```

On first run this generates a self-signed certificate/key pair under
`.azure-emulator-data/tls/` (override with `-tls-cert`/`-tls-key`, or
`AZURE_EMULATOR_TLS_CERT`/`AZURE_EMULATOR_TLS_KEY`) and reuses it on
subsequent runs. Since it's self-signed, both az CLI's Python TLS stack
and `azurerm`'s Go TLS stack need to be told to trust it explicitly:

```powershell
# Windows: trust the cert for both stacks
certutil -addstore Root .azure-emulator-data\tls\cert.pem

# az CLI bundles its own CA list (certifi) instead of using the Windows
# store, so it also needs a combined bundle (its own CAs + this cert):
python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
Get-Content <certifi-cacert-path>, .azure-emulator-data\tls\cert.pem | Set-Content combined-ca-bundle.pem
$env:REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE = (Resolve-Path combined-ca-bundle.pem)
```

`azurerm`'s Go HTTP stack uses the OS certificate store directly, so the
`certutil -addstore Root` step alone is enough for Terraform once the
cert is trusted system-wide.

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This builds the image (multi-stage: `golang:1.22-alpine` for compiling,
`alpine:3.20` for the runtime) and starts a container listening on
`localhost:10000`, persisting its BoltDB file to a named volume
(`emulator-data`) so data survives restarts.

Without compose:

```bash
docker build -t azure-emulator:local .
docker run --rm -p 10000:10000 -v emulator-data:/data azure-emulator:local
```

## Running tests

Every service package ships its own `*_test.go` (ARM CRUD plus
data-plane behavior, via `net/http/httptest` — no real network or
external dependencies needed), and `cmd/azure-emulator` has a test
that reproduces `main()`'s exact service-registration order against a
single `http.ServeMux` to catch duplicate-route panics before they'd
hit a real run:

```bash
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./... -race
```

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same three steps
on every push and pull request.

## Testing with az CLI and Terraform

Every service ships with a way to exercise it from real tooling, not just
`curl`.

### az CLI

az CLI normally expects to discover ARM metadata and authenticate
against real Azure AD before issuing any request. As of Phase 8 the
emulator implements both (`/metadata/endpoints` and a fake token
issuer), and `az cloud register`/`az login --service-principal` against
a `custom` cloud pointed at the emulator gets as far as the token
request — but MSAL's "instance discovery" check rejects `localhost` as
an authority before that, with no flag to disable it in current az CLI
versions. This is a known limitation of the az CLI client itself, not
of the emulator's endpoints (the `azurerm` Terraform provider doesn't
have this problem — see below). Until/unless that's worked around, the
practical way to drive the emulator from az CLI is
[`az rest`](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index#az-rest),
which reuses your cached `az login` token (from a real tenant) but lets
you target any URL, including `localhost`:

```bash
az login                       # once, any account/tenant works
./scripts/test-az-cli.sh       # or test-az-cli.ps1 on Windows
```

This exercises, end to end against a running emulator instance:

- **Resource Manager**: subscription auto-vivification, resource group CRUD.
- **Storage**: storage account CRUD; blob container/blob create/upload/
  list/download/delete; queue create/put/peek/get(dequeue)/delete/delete
  queue; table create/insert/get/query/merge/delete entity/delete table.
- **Compute/Network**: virtual network + subnet CRUD, network interface
  CRUD, managed disk CRUD, VM image catalog lookup, virtual machine
  create/get/start/powerOff/delete — confirming the response never
  echoes back `adminPassword`.
- **Key Vault**: vault create/get/list/delete; secret put/get/list (list
  never echoes back `value`)/delete; key put/get/list/delete;
  certificate put/get/list/delete.
- **Service Bus**: namespace create/get/delete; queue create/delete;
  message send/peek-lock-receive/complete; topic + subscription create/
  delete with fan-out send/receive.
- **Cosmos DB**: account create/get/delete; SQL database create/delete;
  container create/delete; document put/get/list/delete.
- **Monitor/Log Analytics**: workspace create/get/list/delete,
  `sharedKeys` action, Log Analytics Query stub, action group create/
  get/list/delete, metric alert create/get/list/delete, and (Phase 20)
  `createNotifications` dispatching a real webhook POST to a local
  test listener — confirmed `lastNotificationStatus: "ok"` on the
  action group afterward.
- **App Service**: App Service Plan create/get/list/delete; Web App
  create/get/list/delete (referencing a plan by id); app settings put/
  get (StringDictionary, full replace); start/stop/restart actions.
- **Networking**: NSG create/get/delete; security rule put/get/delete
  (rejecting an out-of-range priority); Public IP create/get/update/
  delete (deterministic fake IP, preserved across updates); Load
  Balancer create/get/delete (referencing a Public IP by id plus inline
  frontend/backend/rule); Route Table create/get/delete; route put/get/
  delete (rejecting an unrecognized `nextHopType`); Private DNS zone
  create/get/delete plus A record put/get/delete.
- **AKS**: managed cluster create (async)/get (synthesized default
  agent pool + fake `fqdn`)/list; agent pool put (async)/get/list
  (default + the new pool, both reflected on the parent cluster's
  `agentPoolProfiles`); `listClusterUserCredential` (base64 kubeconfig);
  agent pool delete; managed cluster delete cascading over any
  remaining agent pools.
- **Functions**: App Service Plan Y1/Dynamic create; Function App
  create (`kind=functionapp,linux`, reusing the existing `appservice`
  implementation); function definition put/get/list;
  `syncfunctiontriggers` (204, no body); `host/default/listkeys`
  (non-empty `masterKey`); cleanup deletes of the function/app/plan.
- **Entra ID & RBAC**: application create/get; service principal create
  plus `$filter` auto-discovery; role definition put/get/list; role
  assignment put/get at both subscription and resource-group scope —
  confirming a subscription-scope list never includes a
  resource-group-scope assignment; cleanup deletes of the role
  assignments, role definition, service principal, and application.

### Terraform (generic `http` provider)

`terraform/smoke-test/` uses the generic `http` provider plus
`local-exec` to verify every REST endpoint responds with the expected
shape, independent of any auth flow:

```bash
cd terraform/smoke-test
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This provisions, against the running emulator: a resource group;
storage account (+ blob container/blob, queue + message, table +
entity); virtual network/subnet/NIC/disk/VM; Key Vault (+ secret/key/
certificate); Service Bus namespace (+ queue + message); Cosmos DB
account (+ database/container/document); a Log Analytics workspace +
action group + metric alert (referencing the action group by id); an
App Service Plan + Web App (referencing the plan by id) + app
settings; Networking (NSG + security rule, Public IP, Load Balancer
referencing the Public IP by id plus inline frontend/backend/rule,
Route Table + route, and a Private DNS zone + A record); an AKS
managed cluster + agent pool; a Functions App Service Plan + Function
App + function definition (plus a `syncfunctiontriggers` call); and
Entra ID & RBAC (an application, a service principal, a custom role
definition, and role assignments at both subscription and
resource-group scope). It then reads each one back via `data "http"`
blocks and exposes the parsed JSON as outputs — including a
`role_assignments_sub_list` data source confirming the
subscription-scope list excludes the resource-group-scope assignment.

### Terraform with the real `azurerm` provider

`terraform/azurerm-smoke-test/` points the actual `hashicorp/azurerm`
provider at the emulator (not the generic `http` provider) via
`environment = "custom"` + `metadata_host`, confirming full ARM
metadata discovery, AAD token issuance, service-principal object-ID
resolution (Microsoft Graph), and resource create/destroy all work end
to end:

```bash
go run ./cmd/azure-emulator -tls   # see "Enabling HTTPS" above — required
cd terraform/azurerm-smoke-test
terraform init
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

This requires the cert-trust steps from "Enabling HTTPS" above (Go's
TLS stack, which `azurerm` uses, reads the OS certificate store). It
provisions and destroys a real `azurerm_resource_group`, and reads the
subscription via `data "azurerm_subscription"`.

### Terraform usage examples

Override any default (endpoint, names, location) with `-var` instead of
editing the file:

```bash
terraform apply -var="endpoint=http://localhost:10000" -var="resource_group=my-test-rg" -var="location=westus2"
```

Preview what would change without applying it (useful after editing
`main.tf` or bumping an `api-version`):

```bash
terraform plan
```

Inspect a specific resource's parsed JSON response after `apply` (every
resource created by this smoke test has a matching `<name>_response`
output — see the bottom of `main.tf` for the full list):

```bash
terraform output cosmos_account_response
terraform output sb_message_peek_response
terraform output vm_response
```

Tear everything down — this only destroys Terraform-tracked
`null_resource`/`data` entries (no real Azure billing involved either
way), but it does **not** delete the underlying emulator resources
since those were created via `local-exec` `Invoke-RestMethod` calls,
not real Terraform resources. Use the matching `DELETE` calls in
`scripts/test-az-cli.sh`/`.ps1`, or just restart the emulator with a
fresh `-db` path, to actually clear emulator state:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Full `azurerm` provider compatibility (fake ARM metadata endpoint, fake
AAD token issuer, Microsoft Graph stub, optional TLS, and ARM
case-insensitive path matching) is implemented as of Phase 8 — see
`terraform/azurerm-smoke-test/` above and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for
details, and "az CLI" above for the one remaining known limitation
(MSAL's instance-discovery check rejecting `localhost`).
